I need you to create a program that uses chatgpt to create two data files. The one file inputs.txt is a input file of example user inputs. The other file is outputs.txt which is a series of example responses that the ai may give back based on user inputs. Line 1 of the inputs.txt file corresponds to line 1 of the outputs.txt file they are like pairs this is for the entirety of both files. I need the program to use chatgpt to create a massive amount of data the minimum being 500-1000 lines of data each file so I can train my ai using the data that the program you make me is going to spit out. make sure the data the program makes makes sense the data is train like each line in each file is a conversation pair so I can train my ai with it.
